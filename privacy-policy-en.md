## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Account Information
When you create an account, we collect:
- **Full Name** - To personalize your experience

### 1.2 Business Data
When you use the App, you may create:

- Product and inventory data
- Financial transactions and reports

**Important**: All business data is stored locally on your device by default. Cloud sync is only available for paid subscribers and requires explicit opt-in.

### 1.3 Device Information
We collect limited device information:
- **Device Name** (e.g., "Samsung Galaxy S24") - For display in your devices list
- **Operating System Version** - For compatibility and support purposes

### 1.4 App Installation Identifier
We generate a **random unique identifier (UUID)** when you first install the App. This identifier:
- Is NOT derived from your device hardware
- Is NOT linked to any advertising ID
- Is NOT shared with third parties
- Is used ONLY to enforce subscription device limits
- Can be reset by uninstalling and reinstalling the App

## 2. How We Use Your Information

| Business Data | Provide accounting features | Contract performance |
| Device Name | Display in your devices list | Legitimate interest |

We do NOT:

- ❌ Share your financial data with anyone

---

## 3. Data Storage & Security

### 3.1 Local Storage (Default)
- All business data is stored locally on your device using encrypted SQLite database
- Authentication tokens are stored in secure storage (Android Keystore / iOS Keychain)
- We cannot access your local data

### 3.2 Cloud Storage (Paid Subscribers Only)
- If you subscribe to Pro or Enterprise plan, you can enable cloud sync
- Cloud data is stored on secure servers in [your server location]
- Data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256)

## 4. Device Limits & Identification

### 4.1 How Device Limits Work
To prevent account sharing abuse, we limit the number of devices that can use your account:
- **Free Plan**: 1 device
- **Pro Plan**: 3 devices
- **Enterprise Plan**: Unlimited devices

### 4.2 Our Privacy-Friendly Approach
We use an **app-generated random identifier** instead of hardware fingerprinting:

```
What we DO:
✅ Generate a random UUID when you install the app
✅ Store this UUID securely on your device
✅ Send this UUID to our server to track active devices

What we DON'T do:
❌ Read your Android ID, IMEI, or hardware serial numbers
❌ Create a device fingerprint from system properties
❌ Track you across app reinstalls (new install = new ID)
❌ Share device information with advertisers
```

### 4.3 Resetting Your Device ID
If you want to reset your device identifier:
1. Uninstall the Sijillee app
2. Reinstall from Google Play / App Store
3. Log in to your account
4. A new random ID will be generated

This will count as a "new device" for subscription limits.
